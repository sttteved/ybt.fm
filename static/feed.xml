<p>The #STTT of the Week goes to Havard vs Yale Football Game Climate Protestors who protested in response to the schools being heavily invested in many fossil fuel companies despite having students who overwhelmingly oppose climate change.</p>

        <![CDATA[<p>Y’all Boys’ 10-year High School reunion is one week away and while the pressure is at a fever pitch, that doesn’t stop them from doing impressions of each other and warning you to NEVER TAKE A CASH ADVANCE. This week Frank realizes good mental health sometimes involves unfollowing a playlist, Max skirts around completing his final goals, Steve stop waiting all together and when Josh has some bad news for #TeamJosh, members of #TeamJosh make their frustrations very well known.</p>

<p>The #STTT of the Week goes to Taraji P. Henson who is the co-founder of the Boris Lawrence Henson Foundation which is committed to changing the perception of mental illness in the African-American community by encouraging those who suffer with this debilitating illness to get the help they need.</p>

        <![CDATA[<p>The fiery conclusion to this era of YBT is coming in fast much like the returning Steve sliding down the side of a volcano. After his Central American adventure, Steve reveals an issue he has with his luggage, Frank caves in to the sodium peddling giant that is Panda Express, Max gets halfway through his novel while biding time to find the last person for his non-profit and the figurehead of #TeamJosh tests patience when it comes to his finances.</p>

<p>The #STTT of the Week goes to Anne Henningfeld, co-founder of ‘Beyond Recreation’, a consulting company that trains camp counselors and staff around the country on Empathy and understanding child development. She is also the inventor of the A.C.T. method which allows camp counselors to role play challenging scenarios with actors to better understand how to engage effectively.</p>
